# London Bike Rental Analysis

### Summary

This project uses a publicly available dataset of bike rentals in London to perform a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal was to identify key usage patterns, including the busiest starting stations and the most popular routes, to provide actionable insights for a bike-sharing company.

### Key Findings

Based on an analysis of over 5 million bike rentals, the key findings were:

#### 1. Top 10 Busiest Starting Stations

The busiest stations were overwhelmingly concentrated in and around Hyde Park and major transportation hubs. This suggests that bike rentals are primarily used for recreational purposes or as a "last-mile" commuting solution.

#### 2. Top 10 Most Popular Routes

The most popular routes were all located within a small radius, confirming that bikes are often used for short trips rather than long-distance commuting.

### Methodology

This project was completed using the following tools and methods:

* **Data Source:** I used the `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` dataset from Google BigQuery.

* **Analysis:** All data was analyzed using **SQL** to extract and aggregate the necessary information. The raw code for the queries can be found in this repository.

* **Tools:** SQL, Google BigQuery, Chart.js, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.
