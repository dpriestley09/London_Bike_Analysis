# London Bike Analysis: Optimizing Bike Sharing for City Growth

### Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of London's bike-sharing program. Using public data on over 100,000 trips, I created a comprehensive dashboard to uncover key usage patterns and provide actionable insights for urban planners and the bike-sharing service.

### Key Questions Answered

* What are the most popular bike routes and stations in London?
* How does ridership change based on the time of day and day of the week?
* What is the difference in usage between casual riders and registered members?

### Key Findings & Business Insights

### **Key Findings & Business Insights**

* **Top 10 Busiest Starting Stations:** The analysis revealed that the busiest stations are overwhelmingly concentrated in and around Hyde Park and major transportation hubs. This suggests that bikes are primarily used for recreational purposes or as a **"last-mile" solution** for commuters.
    * **Business Insight:** The bike-sharing service can use this data to strategically rebalance bikes to these stations during peak hours and consider partnerships with local businesses in these areas.

* **Most Popular Routes:** The data shows that the most popular routes are short, indicating that users are making quick trips. This confirms the **utility of bikes for short, point-to-point travel**.
    * **Business Insight:** City planners can leverage this insight to prioritize the construction of new bike lanes and infrastructure along these specific routes to improve safety and ridership.

* **Ridership Trends:** Ridership spikes during the morning and evening rush hours on weekdays and for recreational use on weekends. This highlights two distinct user profiles.
    * **Business Insight:** This information is critical for marketing, allowing the service to run targeted promotionsâ€”offering weekly passes to commuters and hourly rentals to weekend riders.
